As the importance of microbiome research continues to become more prevalent and essential to understanding a wide variety of ecosystems (e.g., marine, built, host-associated, etc.), there is a need for researchers to be able to perform highly reproducible and quality analysis of microbial genomes. MetaSanity incorporates analyses from eleven existing and widely used genome evaluation and annotation suites into a single, distributable workflow, thereby decreasing the workload of microbiologists by allowing for a flexible, expansive data analysis pipeline.
