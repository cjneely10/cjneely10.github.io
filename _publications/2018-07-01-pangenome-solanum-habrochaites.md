Solanum habrochaites is a diploid, wild tomato species that grows on the slopes of the Andes Mountains. Its unique phenotype includes glandular trichomes on the fruit, and these trichomes have been shown to be related to sesquiterpenes and other chemicals that repel insects. Because of these and other specificities, it has been commonly used as an important source of novel genes for tomato breeding. Therefore, we are interested in better understanding the genomic differences between S. habrochaites and the cultivated tomato, S. lycopersicum.
