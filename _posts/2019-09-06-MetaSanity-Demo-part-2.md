In this blog, we will continue our work from the [first demo blog](https://cjneely10.github.io/posts/2019/09/MetaSanity-demo-part-1/). Previously, we had evaluated a set of metagenomic assembled genomes (MAGs).
Now that the set of genomes has been evaluated for quality and we have selected a non-redundant subset, we will not structurally and functionally annotate each genome.
